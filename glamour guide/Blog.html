            <h2>Is it a Keffiyeh, Ghutrah, Shemagh, or Hattah?</h2>
            <p>In the realm of iconic head coverings, the Middle East unveils a tapestry of cultural garments, each unique in its design, heritage, and regional significance. Among the prominent headpieces are the Keffiyeh, Ghutrah, Shemagh, and Hattah, often paired with the Agal. But what differentiates these traditional head coverings?</p>
            
            <h3>The Keffiyeh</h3>
            <p>The Keffiyeh, widely recognized as a symbol of Palestinian heritage, is a square-shaped cloth traditionally made from cotton with a checkered pattern, often in black and white or red and white.</p>
            
            <h3>The Ghutrah</h3>
            <p>Originating from the Arabian Peninsula, the Ghutrah resembles the Keffiyeh but is typically white and secured with the Agal in countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p>

            <h3>The Shemagh</h3>
            <p>Favored in Jordan, Iraq, and the Gulf, the Shemagh is a larger square cloth available in various colors, mainly for protection and cultural expression.</p>

            <h3>The Hattah</h3>
            <p>The Hattah, a turban-style headpiece, often represents tribal affiliation in Yemeni tradition.</p>
